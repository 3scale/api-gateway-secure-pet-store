## Creating and configuring application plans

[Application plans in 3scale](https://support.3scale.net/howtos/api-configuration#application-plans) define the different sets of access rights you might want to allow for consumers of your API. These can determine anything from rate limits, which methods or resources are accessible and which features are enabled. Let's see how we can achieve that on the 3scale API Management portal:

1. Log in to your 3scale account. You’ll see a dashboard of the most important performance figures for your API.  
2. Select the “API” tab from the navigation panel at the top. Then choose “Integration” on the left-hand side to start configuring your API management options.
